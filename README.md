# This is Storyboarder.
Storyboarder is an open source alternative to other more expensive or otherwise exclusive 
storyboarding software solutions such as Adobe Story, Frame Forge, and Toon Boom Storyboard.

## Why Storyboarder?
- It's free.
- It's open source.
- It's active.
- There are big plans ahead.

#### Free 
Free doesn't really need a description - I just figured I would emphasize that one more time.

#### Open Source
Storyboarder is open source now and forever. What does that mean? It means that if you happen
to be a coding guru, you can develop a modification and branch off the project to do your 
own thing. If you feel like you have something to contribute to the project - an idea, code, 
or critique - then please do so! I will certainly accept any pull requests beneficial to the project.

If you are an insanely handsome end user, there are still benefits to you as well. The power of 
open sourcing a project is derived from the fact that developers are constantly encouraged to 
rally behind the project in an attempt to create something awesome that is free to utilize, whether
those developers seek practice coding or to expand on a project they use as well. That means
more consistent updates from a larger potential developer base are likely. Both of those things
benefit you directly.

#### Activity
Storyboarder is a fairly new, but ongoing project to create the most awesome storyboarding tools
available. I will continually work on Storyboarder in order to bring that experience to you.
I will also continually encourage other developers to be excited about realizing a software solution
which makes your life easier when the chance is presented.

#### Big Plans
At this particular moment, Storyboarder is not much more than a few JMenus and a popup here 
or there. However, some of the features I would like to bring to the table are listed below:
##### Decks
Decks are the main organizational structure used in Storyboarder. They contain all the categories 
and cards within those categories which make up a project. A loaded deck will show in the project 
hierarchy for the user to explore and manipulate.
##### Categories
Categories are the bread and butter of Storyboarder. Each category has properties that the user 
may assign on creating the category. These properties will give cards assigned to a category more 
meaning. For example, a user might define a category 'Factions'. For that user's purpose, every faction
in their story may require a banner. That user should then simply add a property named banner to the 
Faction category in order to assert that all cards added to that category should have a field where an 
image file may be placed to represent that faction's banner. From then on, that image will propagate 
throughout the system - making connections between associated cards and generating content that will 
help visualize every faction in their story.
##### Team Collaboration
The name says it all. Team collaboration is an important aspect of creating any well fleshed out story. 
Storyboarder will incorporate methods which allow individuals to work collaboratively over the internet 
or on a local network.
##### Themes
Storyboarder looking a little dull? Well I think you should be able to change that. Storyboarder will 
be able to read theme data from a configurations file in order to change visual aspects of the program.
